# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 21, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Gone through parts 0-3 or the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/) and deployed example site to Gatsby Cloud.

**Thoughts** I've recently started learning Gatsby. Since it uses ReactJS, it has been easy for me to pick up on the basic concepts.
